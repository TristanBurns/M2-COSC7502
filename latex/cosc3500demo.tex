\end{abstract}
This report details the serial implementation, verification and performance optimisation of solution to the OneMax problem using a Genetic Algorithm implemented in C++. 

\section{Serial Implementation} 
\subsection{Algorithm} 
The genetic algorithm is a type of metaheuristic optimisation algorithm which has biologically inspired iterative crossover and mutation of candidate solutions. 

Pseudo-code for the algorithm implemented in this project is presented in  Algorithm 1. 

\begin{algorithm}

\EndFor
\State  $p\gets q$
\State $generation++$
\EndWhile \\
\Return $best$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

There are many possible variations on the genetic algorithm. Key features of this implementation are summarised as comments in Algorithm 1.


\subsection{OneMax Problem}
The OneMax problem is defined as the maximum number of value 1 bits in a bit string. Solution of the OneMax problem is effectively searching for a bitsting of exclusively ones. 

For the Genetic Algorithm this is encoded in the chromosome, with possible genes of 0 or 1. In this implementation, a Genetic Algorithm is used to search through a population of \(m\) individuals with chromosomes of length \(n\) for a chromosome consisting of only ones. In this case a fitness function is defined to be the sum of all chromosomes, with optimal fitness being equal to the chromosome sum \(n\).

\subsection{Program Implementation}
The genetic algorithm was implemented in C++ and compiled to C++11 standard using g++. Optimisation flags are discussed in Section 4.3 below.

The program is structured to use of macros for user defined constants and static arrays with memory allocated at compile time. In order to maximise performance, verbose functions were duplicates of the non-verbose counterparts, to avoid passing verbose arguments with subsequent internal branching. 

\section{Verification}
The implementation was verified through explicit inspection of verbose output results and plotting the (normalised fitness over time) for a number of trials. An advantage of the OneMax problem is that the optimal solution and associated fitness is the same as the chromosome size \(n\), permitting easy verification.  Because of the stochastic nature of genetic algorithms a  random seed was defined as an input parameter to enable deterministic and repeatable results.

Verbose output allowed for explicit verification of the key steps of the Genetic Algorithm, namely computing fitness, \textit{crossover} and \textit{mutation} verification. See Annex A for a single loop of verbose output.

\end{figure}

\section{Performance Optimisation}

\subsection{Manual Optimisation}
An attempt was made to manually optimise the code based on gprof profiling. The program was compiled with the \textit{-pg -O0} flags set. Based on gprof profiling (see Annex B), the function \textit{Mutate} (see below), was identifed as taking approximately 21 percent of the runtime. 
\begin{lstlisting}
void Mutate(int *q, int n, int m)
{
    int mu;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            mu = (std::rand() % n);
            if (mu == 0)
            {
                (q(i, j)) = 1 - (q(i, j));
            }
        }

    }
    return;
}
\end{lstlisting}
An attempt was made to remove the internal branching as follows. 
\begin{lstlisting}
void Mutate(int *q, int n, int m)
{
    int mu;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    {
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            mu = ((std::rand() % n)==0);
            q(i, j) = (q(i, j))*(1-mu) + (1 - (q(i, j)))*(mu); //remove branching
        }

    }
    return;
}
\end{lstlisting}
However, followup profiling revealed that this actually made performance worse with the function \textit{Mutate} taking approximately 37 percent of the runtime. Therefore, this implementation was reverted and optimisation was focused on compile flags, as discussed in section 4.2


\subsection{Optimisation Flags}
Because of the number of nested loops in the \textit{Crossover}, \textit{Assess Individual fitness} and \textit{Mutate}, it was inferred that -funroll-loops would yield improvements.

What was unexpected, was the flags -flto and -fuse-linker-plugin in combination yielding a ~10-20 percent improvement on -O3 optimisation alone.  Although I do not  understand this improvement from the documentation, I hypothesise that these flags improve the optimization by exposing more code to the link-time optimizer. 

\subsection{Performance Results}
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{avruntime2.png}
	\caption{Average runtime (ten trials) vs chromosome size, \(n\), for a population size of \(m=100\) individuals. Based on different optimisation flags a \(\sim 2.8\times\) speedup is achieved. These results were computed using the same random seed, \textit{seed }\(=42\).}

Random communication patterns are difficult to implement in MPI. MPI is based on all ranks having a deterministic set of communication patterns.
